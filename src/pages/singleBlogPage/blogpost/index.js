                After one month of journaling, I stopped getting angry at people.<br /> After three months of journaling, I knew traveling/adventure was what brought me the most joy.<br /><br />
                After 8 months of journaling, I realized that maybe writing is what I should do for the rest of my life.<br /><br />
                A lot of people get beaten down by their thoughts.<br /> Me? I have a full-blown recorded conversation with them. I spar. I find weaknesses — flaws. I find opportunities.<br /><br />
                Every time I step in the ring with my mind I get hurt, but I find out that much more about myself by the time I’m done.<br /><br />
                Competing in a boxing match will always hurt, but there’s also always a winner.<br />

                Everybody wants to better themselves.<br /> They make grand plans to do so and it almost always falls apart.<br /><br />
                I promise you the quickest way to bettering yourself is to write.<br /><br />
                If you want to speed that up, try writing online.<br /><br />
                Here you aren’t just sparring with your mind, you’re sparring with other people’s minds in the comments and they aren’t afraid to tell you you’re dead wrong.<br /><br />
                In fact, a lot of people quite enjoy it.<br /><br />
                So here’s to writing — the thing that’s made me who I am, and the thing that’ll make me who I’ll be tomorrow.
